ASCIIfy Application Optimization Prompt
Key Issues and Solutions for ASCIIfy
ASCIIfy is a browser-based ASCII art converter for images and videos that needs several optimizations to improve its handling of video animations. The application should maintain its simplicity with binary and blocks character sets while addressing the following issues:
1. Single Loop Export Precision
Issue: The current implementation doesn't guarantee capturing exactly one full video loop.
Solution: Modify the captureVideoFrames() function to track loop completion by comparing the current video time with the last captured time. Add a lastCaptureTime state variable and stop capture automatically when detecting that the video has looped back to the beginning.
2. Frame Rate Consistency
Issue: Exported animations may not match the timing of the original video.
Solution: Revise the adjustFramesByFps() function to calculate the exact number of frames needed based on the video duration and target FPS. Distribute frames evenly across the original duration to maintain consistent timing.
3. Loop Transition Smoothness
Issue: There's often a visible jump between the end and beginning frames when looping.
Solution: Add metadata to identify first and last frames during capture. Create a smoothLoopTransition() function that detects transition issues and creates intermediate blended frames if needed to ensure smooth looping.
4. Export Progress Accuracy
Issue: Progress indicators during export don't accurately reflect the actual operation progress.
Solution: Implement a step-based progress system in the finalizeExport() function with clear stages (preprocessing, adjusting frames, formatting data, creating output file). Update the progress bar at each stage with descriptive messages.
5. Animation Preview Control
Issue: The preview functionality doesn't perfectly match what will be exported.
Solution: Modify the startPreview() function to use the exact same frame processing that would be applied during export. Create a previewProcessedFrames() helper function that applies the same adjustments to preview frames as would be done for export.
6. Settings Impact Visualization
Issue: The full impact of settings adjustments on the exported animation isn't clearly visible.
Solution: Enhance the updateSettings() function to provide real-time feedback on how current settings will affect the final output. Add visual indicators that show the effect of brightness, contrast, and edge detection on sample frames.
7. Resource Cleanup
Issue: Video resources aren't consistently cleaned up between operations.
Solution: Create a comprehensive cleanupVideoResources() function that properly stops captures, clears video elements, and revokes object URLs. Call this function whenever a new file is uploaded or the application is reset.
Implementation Priorities

Fix the loop capture mechanism to ensure capturing exactly one complete loop
Improve frame timing consistency between the original video and export
Implement smooth transitions between the end and start frames
Create accurate progress indicators for the export process
Ensure preview matches what will be exported
Add better visualization of settings impacts
Implement proper resource cleanup

The optimized application should maintain its current functionality while providing a more accurate and reliable experience when working with video animations on desktop web browsers.
